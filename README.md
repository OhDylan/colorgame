# Basic color game

Colt Steele Web Development Bootcamp

Easy to create and provides a good understanding for beginners who just started looking into front end web dev, HTML, CSS and Javascript. It involves basic styling of CSS without third party library. Besides, basic DOM manipulation and for loops are implemented in this project as well.

Students have to create 2 different presentations when easy and hard modes are toggled. Well, basic but good for those who just got in touch with web development.

This is the case of Easy mode.
